Player Human A: you are going to place the following ships
For each ship, type the coordinate of the upper left
side of the ship, followed by either H (for horizontal) or V (for
vertical) for Submarine and Destroyer, followed by U(up), R(Right),
D(down) or L(left) for Battleship and Carrier. For example
M4H would place a Submarine or Destoyer horizontally starting
at M4 and going to the right.  You have

2 "Submarines" ships that are 1x2
3 "Destroyers" that are 1x3
3 "Battleships" 
2 "Carriers"
